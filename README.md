The game board is a grid where each player takes a turn and plays.

- The game starts by prompting both players for their names.
- Player one always starts, then player two
- Symbol ('X') represents player one moves and ('O') represents player two.
- Valid inputs are (a1-a3, b1-b3, c1-c3), representing Row_Number & Column_Name
- In order to win the game, a player must place three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.
